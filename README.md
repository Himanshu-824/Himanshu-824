# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Himanshu**, a Java developer based in India.

I love designing and building software that solves real-world problems.  
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack includes **Core Java, JDBC, MySQL**, and I’m currently exploring **Spring Boot** and full-stack development.  
My favorite tools are **VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and MySQL Workbench**.

I’ve built multiple projects, but my favorite so far is the **Banking Management System**.

I’m continuously learning, experimenting, and improving my craft.  
More projects and open-source work are coming soon.
