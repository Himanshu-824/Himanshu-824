# Hey there 👋

I'm Himanshu, a software developer based in India.  

I mostly work on backend development — Core Java, JDBC, MySQL — and I'm currently exploring Spring Boot and full-stack technologies.

I also enjoy frontend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, allowing me to build clean and interactive user interfaces.

This is a fresh profile where I’ll be uploading small projects, experiments, and things I’m currently learning.  
Everything here is built from scratch — no templates, just honest work and continuous improvement.
